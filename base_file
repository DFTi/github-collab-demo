  bundle gem <name>
2 Create a new repository on Github and upload the gem
3 Create a milestone together with semantic versioning.
4 Add jeanres as a collaborator
5 Jeanre will fork the project!!!!!! :)
6 He will create two issues as he analyzes the milestone
7 Jeanre will fork, set upstream, assign himself to an issue, and start to working on a branch, pushing to his origin
8 I will assign myself an issue, branch, and finish it, ref the issue in my commit and push to master; modify a file that will conflict w Jeanre
9 Jeanre will notice the work via HipChat and fetch and rebase into his branch, continuing his work after fixing the conflict.
